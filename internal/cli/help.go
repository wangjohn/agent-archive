	"recover": `Usage: agent-archive recover SESSION_ID [--confirm]

Preview recovery of a local top-level append-only transcript blocked by a
rewrite. Keep its history, feedback and handoffs; freeze its future native
capture, and queue one new archive generation from the current transcript.
Normal sync publishes it. Each generation expires under normal retention.
Repeated confirmation of the old SESSION_ID returns the same successor. Imports
remain in their original undo batch. Existing subagents keep their parent;
new subagents use the active generation. Direct subagent recovery is not
supported: start a fresh parent session instead. No storage is accessed.
Recovery permanently fences older binaries out of this data directory.
  --confirm    Start or resume the previewed generation without prompting
`,
	"eval": `Usage: agent-archive eval export SESSION_ID... | --ids-from - | --scan
       | --file PATH --harness NAME [--detail metadata|full] [--max-bytes N]

Export sessions for an evaluation tool, one JSON Lines record per session
(schemas/eval-export.schema.json), from the archive or from transcripts on
this machine. Read-only and never interactive.

       agent-archive eval export --file PATH --harness NAME [--detail ...]
       Any of them also takes [--max-bytes N] [--workers N].

Print one JSON line per session: its identity, commits, counts, tokens and
tools, and with --detail full (the default) its filtered human prompts in
order, final response, edited files and feedback. Archived sessions are
named by full SESSION_ID. Transcripts on this machine (--file, --scan, or
absolute paths with --ids-from) need no setup and are filtered as they
would be before upload. With several workers each record is written as its
session finishes. A session that cannot be exported is an error record on
its own line; the others are still printed, and the exit code is 1.
Nothing is uploaded or written.
  --detail metadata|full     metadata prints no conversation text and, for
                             the archive, reads only sidecars (default full)

  --max-bytes N              Cut each record's longest texts to fit N bytes

       agent-archive machines revoke --operation-id OPERATION_ID
       [--yes] [--json]

Bucket claims never authorize deletion. Verify immutable ownership through a
local assignment, healthy issuer ledger or independently checked operator file.
Unknown ownership refuses even under --yes. No token records a request only.
A provider 404 remains unknown; a request is never proof of access removal.
Self's active object key is deleted last. Sessions and downloaded data remain.
  --machine-id MACHINE_ID   Select an independently bound immutable machine

`,
	"machines own-key": `Usage: agent-archive machines own-key [--yes] [--cancel]

Stage and check a dedicated key, then commit through setup's transaction.
Existing machine identity remains. Shared access stays valid for other users.
Remove the old local secret only after commit and only when no other local
destination needs it. Record publication retries independently of commit.
  --yes          Require environment token; never prompt or run a command
  --cancel       Remove only a proven uncommitted staged dedicated key

	"machines add": `Usage: agent-archive machines add [--name NAME] [--share-key] [--spares 0..5]
       [--expires 15m] [--print | --file PATH] [--yes]

Create an encrypted pairing bundle after checking the source storage.
An available management token creates
and checks a fresh key; otherwise use a ledger-backed spare. --yes never shares
implicitly. --share-key explicitly selects shared-key pairing without
independent recipient revocation.
S3 transfers settings and a profile name. Configure the profile on the receiver.
Deliver the bundle and six-word code separately. Pairing refuses in any coding
agent, even with --yes or AGENT_ARCHIVE_NONINTERACTIVE=0.
  --name NAME    Recipient name: 1..40 lowercase letters, digits or hyphens
  --share-key    Explicitly share the active R2 key (shared access)
  --spares N     Save unused R2 key target, 0..5 (default 2)
                 Refill with an available management token
  --expires DURATION  Lifetime from 5m to 24h (default: 15m)
  --print        Print the encrypted bundle instead of copying it
  --file PATH    Create a private 0600 bundle file; never overwrite a file
  --yes          Require --name and deliberately print bundle and code
                 (with --file, print only the separately delivered code)
Interactive delivery needs terminal input and output; codes use a cleared
alternate screen. Clipboard contents are
cleared on normal exit only if they still equal the bundle. Interrupted delivery
remains uncertain in the local ledger; dedicated keys are never recycled after
attempted exposure. Issuer-local delivered secrets are removed on exit; lineage
remains. Spare refill failure does not invalidate the delivered pairing.
`,
	"machines": `Usage: agent-archive machines [--json] [--verify] [--yes]

List informational machine records from this bucket.
--verify requests a read-only Cloudflare metadata check. Account inventory
completeness remains unknown; matching metadata never proves ownership or access
removal.
Anyone with bucket access can forge records; they never authorize revocation.
Heartbeat is updated at most daily and does not indicate current activity.
Unreadable records and incomplete listings are reported; those exit with code 1.
  --json    Write records and observations as JSON
            Never prompt or run a token command
  --verify  Explicit bounded provider metadata check for this R2 bucket
  --yes     With --verify, require CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN and never prompt
`,
	"machines rename": `Usage: agent-archive machines rename [CURRENT_NAME|MACHINE_ID] NEW_NAME

Rename this machine only, keeping its immutable machine and credential IDs.
Use the full MACHINE_ID when a current name is ambiguous. The new name has
1 to 40 lowercase letters, digits, or hyphens, starting with a letter or digit.
Observed duplicate names are refused; concurrent naming can still race.
A failed publication keeps the local name and the collector retries.

	"purge": `Usage: agent-archive purge plan [--mode unreferenced|old-filter]
       [--before-filter VERSION] [--no-pager]
       agent-archive purge apply PLAN [--yes]

Create a private five-minute deletion plan, then review its exact keys.
Plan lists still-current older-filter sessions separately and never proposes
their current sources for deletion. Pause every machine uploading to this prefix
before apply. A versioned bucket keeps noncurrent versions and delete markers.
`,
	"purge plan": `Usage: agent-archive purge plan [--mode unreferenced|old-filter]
       [--before-filter VERSION] [--no-pager]

Read metadata and list source objects without deleting anything. Old-filter
mode selects only unreferenced sources whose filter version is below VERSION;
both modes report still-current older-filter sessions separately. On a
terminal, the plan is paged through $PAGER unless --no-pager.
`,
	"purge apply": `Usage: agent-archive purge apply PLAN [--yes]

Pause every uploading machine first. Confirm the plan digest or use --yes.
Apply rechecks remote metadata before each deletion and writes a resumable
report next to the plan. A plan expires five minutes after creation.

               [--allow-network-home]
       agent-archive setup --refresh [--verbose]

Choose apps and projects, connect storage, then review and enable capture.
Run again to continue saved setup or edit capture, storage, or retention.
Credentials are entered privately; never pass them as command arguments.
Setup asks questions, so it needs a terminal, unless --yes is given.
An interrupted setup is recovered on the next run.
  --pair                Receive an encrypted bundle and hidden terminal code
  --pair-file PATH|-    Read a bounded bundle file or stdin; with --yes read and
                        unset AGENT_ARCHIVE_PAIRING_CODE. Never a code flag.
                        Pairing refuses inside coding agents. --yes refuses a
                        destination change; interactive review requires consent.
  --refresh             After upgrading agent-archive: bring the app hooks, the
                        background job's definition, and the skill files up to
                        date for the saved settings and this executable, and
                        change nothing else. Asks nothing and needs no
                        terminal; the installer runs it. Prints "nothing to
                        refresh" when all is current. It refuses, changing
                        nothing, before setup has finished, while a setup
                        needs recovery, after uninstall, when another
                        installation's hooks are in the way, when this
                        executable is a temporary build, or (Linux) when the
                        data directory or the systemd unit directory is on a
                        network filesystem that --allow-network-home never
                        allowed. It points the hooks at the executable now
                        running, which repairs hooks left pointing at one
                        that moved or was deleted. Takes no other flag than
                        --verbose (which lists the files)
  --abandon-recovery    If recovery stops because a file it changed was
                        edited since, keep every file as it is now and
                        discard the interrupted setup; then run setup again
  --verbose             If the storage check fails, also show the storage
                        provider's own error under the diagnosis
  --yes                 Ask nothing: take the answers below, the saved
                        settings, and the apps found; run the same storage
                        check; and save. Refuses if an answer is missing
  --provider r2|s3      Storage provider (default: the saved storage)
  --bucket NAME         Bucket (R2: or from --r2-account's URL)
  --r2-account ACCOUNT|URL
                        The R2 account, or the bucket URL the dashboard shows

  --prefix PREFIX       Folder inside the bucket (default: saved folder, else

  --retention-days DAYS Keep sessions for 1 to 36500 days (default: saved,

  --require-skill-use   Capture only sessions that use skills
  --no-require-skill-use
                        Capture sessions with or without skills (default:
                        saved setting, else capture both)
  --project DIR         Capture this project, besides any saved (repeatable)
  --project-repo KEY    Capture a unique local repo by key (repeatable)
                       Skip ambiguous, excluded, or incomplete matches
  --project-scope JSON  Transfer include/exclude rules together; repository
                        subtrees follow the unique local checkout
  --project-scope-file PATH  Read those rules from a file, or - for stdin
                        Scope transfer accepts at most 4096 rules
                        Scope flags need a nonempty value and cannot mix

  --apps LIST           Apps to capture: codex,claude,cursor (default: the
                        saved apps, else those found on this machine). It must
                        name every app set up now: --yes never removes one
  --no-skills           Install no agent skills (such as /handoff), and
                        remove those setup wrote. Later setup runs keep
                        them off until --skills
  --skills              Turn the agent skills back on and install them
  --allow-network-home  Linux: allow the data directory or the systemd unit
                        directory (under your home) on a network filesystem
                        (NFS, SMB, ...), which setup otherwise refuses,
                        changing nothing, because machines that share a home
                        share one identity, cannot rely on file locks, and
                        each run the background job. Only for a home that one
                        machine ever mounts; recorded while it is needed
  --codex-discovery MODE on or off; fresh scripted Codex setup must choose.
                        Reconfiguration keeps an omitted choice. Discovery
                        finds supported sources; recent native copies may count
  --codex-capture-scope MODE included-projects or all-projects (Codex only).
                        Fresh scripts must choose; default: included projects.
                        Omitted reconfiguration never expands recorded scope.
                        all-projects with discovery off uses approved hooks only
  --skill-evidence MODE none: no filesystem skill evidence; metadata: names
                        and filtered hashes; body: filtered SKILL.md text.
                        Fresh setup defaults to metadata; earlier configs
                        without this field keep body until changed.
With --yes, the R2 secret access key is read from
AGENT_ARCHIVE_R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, or else from standard input.

	"status": `Usage: agent-archive status [APP] [--verbose] [--json] [--no-pager]

Show local capture evidence, background health, and a next step.
No conversations are printed and no cloud request is made.
Each app's line counts its sessions, imports and uploads, with at most
five uploading sessions under it; the screen doesn't grow with projects.
APP (claude, codex or cursor) shows that app in full: every uploading
session and a table of its projects.
--verbose adds each project's progress, skill evidence, imports and
every error, then a Details section with the codes, exact times, full
paths and raw errors behind each line.
On a terminal, status is paged through $PAGER unless --no-pager.
--json prints the same status as a versioned JSON document. In it,
storage_verified_at is when setup's storage check last passed, and
storage_access_confirmed_at is the latest confirmation of access (by
"setup" or the "collector", in storage_access_confirmed_by).

	"sync": `Usage: agent-archive sync

Collect and upload once. Failures leave pending work available to retry.
If paused, no work is started; run agent-archive resume first.
Example: agent-archive sync
`,
	"pause": `Usage: agent-archive pause

Persistently pause collection, uploads, and cleanup. Current work must finish
before the command can confirm pause; retry if another operation is running.
Already registered sessions can catch up after resume, including activity
written during the pause. New sessions begun while paused are not imported.
Example: agent-archive pause

	"resume": `Usage: agent-archive resume

Resume scheduled collection, uploads, and cleanup. Already registered sessions
can catch up, including activity written during the pause. For an immediate
pass, run agent-archive sync.
Example: agent-archive resume
`,
	"uninstall": `Usage: agent-archive uninstall [--delete-local-data] [--skip-scheduler] [--yes]

Remove hooks, the agent skills (/handoff and agent-archive), and the
background collector. Keep local evidence,
settings, and credentials by default, so setup can restore the installation.
--delete-local-data also removes owned local files and stored credentials,
including unpublished evidence, after a separate confirmation.
--skip-scheduler goes on when the background scheduler cannot be reached (no
user session bus, for example): it tries to stop the job, removes its
definition and the rest all the same, prints the command that stops the job by
hand, and says the job was not verified stopped. Without it, uninstall stops
there and changes nothing.
--yes skips the confirmations; it is required without a terminal.
Remote archives and unrelated files are always kept.
Example: agent-archive uninstall
`,
	"list": `Usage: agent-archive list [WORDS] [options]

Find sessions using metadata; does not download conversation content.
With WORDS (quote them: one argument), list only the sessions they match.
Every word must appear, in any case, in some field of a session: its name,
title, branch, project name, harness, or the start of its SESSION_ID (4
characters or more). A word like #212 or 212 also matches a pull request
number, and never the start of a SESSION_ID. Words may match different
fields, so "linux 212" finds the session named for Linux that opened PR 212.
Inside a project the search looks at that repository's top-level sessions
first, then at every project's, and only then at subagent sessions, in that
order; the first that has a match answers, and a note says how many more match
in other projects. The words are matched against metadata, never the
conversation. Without WORDS, the table and browser list top-level sessions
only: subagent sessions are left out before --limit counts, and the footer
says how many; a parent shows how many it has. --json without WORDS lists
every session, subagents included.
Run inside a project, it lists that repository's sessions (every checkout and
worktree of it, and its sessions from other machines), with a heading naming the
repository; when there are none, it lists all projects and says so. --project
lists another project's, and --all-projects every project's. Outside any
project it lists every session, grouped by project. On a terminal, the a key,
typed alone, switches between the repository and all projects.
Default text columns: TITLE (the Claude Code or Cursor session name when
available, else a preview of its first filtered prompt, else a short
SESSION_ID prefix; Codex uses the prompt preview), PR (the
last pull request the session linked or created, when any row has one),
relative capture time, harness, project, and a short SESSION_ID. A harness or
project every row shares is left out of the table and named in the heading.
On a terminal with an interactive stdin, list a numbered table and pick a
session to show its summary, then t for its transcript, Enter or b to go
back, or q to quit. Keys act as pressed; the wheel, arrows, and PgUp/PgDn
scroll. Press / to filter the rows as you type, with the words WORDS takes:
the first match is highlighted, the arrows move the highlight, Enter shows it,
and Esc clears the filter. A subagent that matches is shown under its parent,
which is shown too. Rows keep their numbers while filtered. WORDS open the
browser with the filter already filled in, to edit. Where keys cannot be read,
the browser reads lines, and an answer that is not a row number, a
SESSION_ID, or q is words to filter by (an empty answer clears them). Piped
or --json output is never interactive, nor is any run with
AGENT_ARCHIVE_NONINTERACTIVE on, as it is inside coding agents (see the
configuration reference). On a terminal without interactive stdin, text is
paged through $PAGER unless --no-pager.

	"show": `Usage: agent-archive show [SESSION_ID|WORDS] [options]

Print a readable summary of a session's metadata: title, when, app, models,
activity counts, skills, subagents, and capture gaps. --json prints the
metadata sidecar instead. WORDS also work, as in list: every word must appear
in some field of a session (name, title, branch, project, harness, the start
of its SESSION_ID from 4 characters, or a PR number such as #212), looking at
this repository's sessions first. One match is shown; several on a terminal
open the browser on them, with the words in its filter, and without one they
are listed with the command to run next. With --json or --transcript the
browser picks the one session to print instead.
With no SESSION_ID on a terminal, browse sessions as list does: pick one for
its summary, then t for its transcript, Enter or b to go back, or q to quit,
and press / to filter the rows as you type. With --json, it picks one session
and prints its sidecar.
On a terminal, the summary and transcript are paged; in the default less,
scroll with the mouse wheel, arrows, or space, search with /, and quit with
q. Nothing is asked when AGENT_ARCHIVE_NONINTERACTIVE is on, as it is inside
coding agents: give a SESSION_ID.

	"stats": `Usage: agent-archive stats [options]

Show how you use your coding agents. The default screen is a summary of the
last 30 days: estimated spend, sessions and tokens (with the change from the
30 days before), which agents did the work, daily spend, where it went by
project and model, the skills and MCP servers used most, and anything worth a
look. Reads metadata only; prints numbers and names, never prompts or paths.
Cost is an estimate at list price, not a bill, from a dated price table.
Tokens and cost say "unknown" for sessions that record none (Cursor). A
subagent's tokens count with its session. Sessions are placed by capture
time, so imported sessions appear on the day they were imported.
Two columns of bars from 80 terminal columns, one column from 60, a compact
table below that. Color on a color terminal (16 ANSI colors; NO_COLOR turns it
off). Not a terminal: no color, full layout.

arrows, j, k, PgUp, PgDn, space, Home and End scroll, h saves the redacted

	"handoff": `Usage: agent-archive handoff [SESSION_ID|WORDS|--latest|--file PATH] [options]

Before setup, browse Claude Code and Codex native sessions in this checkout
and its descendants. Local IDs (qualified with --harness) or unique prefixes
select beyond the first 50 filtered previews. o loads another 50 explicitly;
/ filters loaded rows only. Word queries report their bounded preview window.
--project requires a directory; --all-projects explicitly broadens the scope.
Local --latest ranks file modification time and requires complete identity
coverage. Direct --to uses an exact current identity or asks for selection;
it never guesses newest. --source archive requires setup. No capture hooks,
credentials, configuration, registrations or scheduler are created. Private
temporary launch files survive launch; later local handoffs clean owned files
older than seven days, best effort. Cursor discovery is not automatic.


After setup, continue a session in another coding agent. On a terminal, pick
a session
(this machine's, including ones not yet uploaded, and archived ones), then pick
where to continue: an installed agent starts in this terminal with the
session as its context (Enter takes handoff.default_to in config.json, else
Codex for a Claude Code session and Claude Code for the others), or print,
copy to the clipboard, or write to a file. Inside Claude Code, /handoff codex
runs handoff --to codex, which opens Codex in a new terminal tab or window.
The session is filtered as it is for the archive: injected instructions and
credentials removed, tool output trimmed, edit bodies left out. A session on
this machine is read from its transcript now; otherwise it is downloaded from
the archive. Piped, or with --output, --format json, or --no-preamble, it
prints without asking. Without a terminal, give a SESSION_ID or WORDS,
--latest, or --file PATH (or --to, from inside an agent). Inside a coding
agent, or with AGENT_ARCHIVE_NONINTERACTIVE=1, it never asks, even on a
terminal.
After setup, WORDS are matched as list matches them: every word must appear,
in any case,
in some field of a session (its name, title, branch, project name, harness, or
the start of its SESSION_ID, from 4 characters), and a word like #212 or 212
also matches a pull request number, never a SESSION_ID. Quote them as one
argument, and use one or two distinctive words: a topic, a PR number, a
branch, or a project name. They look in this machine's sessions first (no
network), then the archive's; a full SESSION_ID wins, and subagent sessions
answer only when no other session matches. Inside a project, the picker and
WORDS look at that repository's sessions first (every checkout and worktree of
it), then everywhere; a note says how many more match in other projects.
On the picker, the a key, typed alone, switches between the repository and
all projects, and / filters the rows as you type (the arrows move the
highlight, Enter hands off the highlighted session, Esc clears the filter; a
subagent that matches shows under its parent). The heading names what is shown,
and a dot marks a session active in the last 2 minutes. Several matches on a
terminal open the same picker on them, with the words in its filter; without
one, or inside a coding agent, they are listed on
stderr, with a PR column and the exact command to run next, and the command
exits 1, never guessing. WORDS skip the agent session running the command,
unless --to is given.
  --latest              The most recent session for the project: one that ran
                        at this path, else one from another checkout of the
                        same repository (its remote origin), such as on
                        another Mac. A match by repository alone is named
                        before anything is downloaded and, on a terminal, asked
                        about (default no); with no terminal it is refused
                        and the SESSION_ID command printed, since a
                        repository chooses its own origin
  --project DIR|NAME    The project to pick from and search, in place of

                        off the agent session it runs in, else picks one on

                        window, and the command returns. If the session was
                        active in this checkout in the last 2 minutes, a
