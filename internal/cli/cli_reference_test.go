<!-- Generated from the commands' own help and flag sets. Do not edit by
     hand; after changing a command's help or flags, regenerate it with
     go test ./internal/cli -run TestCLIReferenceIsCurrent -update -->

Every public command of ` + "`agent-archive`" + `: its help, exactly as
` + "`agent-archive help COMMAND`" + ` (or ` + "`agent-archive COMMAND --help`" + `) prints it,
the flags its parser accepts, and a link to the guide that walks through it.
New to agent-archive? Start with [install](../getting-started/install.md) and
[setup](../getting-started/setup.md); the [glossary](glossary.md) explains
terms such as capture, collector, and retention.

Every command also accepts ` + "`--help`" + ` and ` + "`-h`" + `. Help never activates
hooks, reads credentials, or changes state. The hidden commands ` + "`_hook`" + ` and
` + "`_collect`" + ` (what app hooks and the LaunchAgent run) are not part of the
interface and are left out.

This page is generated from the CLI itself, and ` + "`go test ./...`" + ` fails when it
is stale. After changing a command's help or flags, regenerate it with
` + "`go test ./internal/cli -run TestCLIReferenceIsCurrent -update`" + ` (see
[fixtures and goldens](../../dev/contributing/testing.md#fixtures-and-goldens)).

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Success, and help. |
| 1 | An operational failure. What a command was asked for goes to stdout; why it did not do it, or not all of it, goes to stderr. A ` + "`sync`" + ` that is paused, finds another command running, or fails for some sessions exits 1; its summary line, if it ran, stays on stdout. |
| 2 | A usage error: an unknown command or flag, a bad flag value, or an unexpected argument. It is reported in one line on stderr before the command does anything. |
| 128 + signal | ` + "`backfill`" + ` stopped at once by a second Ctrl-C (130), SIGHUP (129), or SIGTERM (143). |
