// The stats screen's color table: the only place a color is chosen. Every
// entry is a code from the terminal's own 16 ANSI colors (or bold or dim), so
// the screen follows the user's theme; no 256-color or truecolor code is ever
// written. A color is a role, never the only carrier of a meaning: each
// colored element also has a label, a glyph or a position that says the same
// (see statsColorsHaveNonColorCues in the tests).
//
//	agents        Claude Code yellow, Cursor blue, Codex green
//	model family  opus magenta, fable bright red, sonnet cyan, haiku yellow,
//	              gpt and codex models green
//	projects      cyan
//	daily spend   cyan
//	deltas        spend up yellow (amber), down green; never red
//	heads-up      yellow bullets
//	token types   cache read blue, cache write yellow, input green, output magenta
//	labels        dim; emphasis bold
//	key bar       keys bold, labels dim, the active view in reverse video
//
// Yellow carries three meanings (Claude Code, a heads-up bullet and a rise in
// spend, and the haiku and cache-write colors on other screens). They are far
// apart on a screen and each has a label or a glyph beside it. Only marks are
// yellow (a bullet, a bar, an arrow with its figure), never a sentence or an
// amount, because yellow text is hard to read on a light background.
//
// Judged on the screens rendered on a dark, a light, a Solarized dark and a
// Solarized light background: the yellow of Claude Code's bar, of a heads-up
// bullet and of a rise in spend does not read as one thing, because the bar is
// a large block under a legend that names it and the other two are a bullet
// and an arrow far below and above it. Two hues that do run together are
// Claude Code (Solarized's mustard) and Codex (its olive), which sit side by
// side on the agents bar; they are told apart by the blank cell between the
// segments and by the legend's names, as the color rule requires. The detail
// screen puts the agents' colors beside the token types' (cache write is also
// yellow, cache read blue, fresh input green): each bullet is labeled and the
// two lists are under different headings, so no color is asked to carry both.
//
// Dim (SGR 2) rather than bright black is the grey: bright black is the
// background itself in some popular themes (Solarized), and the rest of the
// command line already uses dim for secondary text.
