// writeUnderLock replaces w.path with what w.change computes from the file's

//
// Hooks wait a second for the request lock (lockRequest) and for a subagent
// candidate's lock, inside the harness's two-second hook budget, and the
// turn's evidence is lost when the lock stays held longer. A durable write
// syncs the file and then its directory, each an F_FULLFSYNC on macOS, and
// together they have been measured past two seconds on a loaded Mac. So no
// holder of the lock may sync under it:
//
//  1. The file is read without the lock, change computes the new content
//     from it, and that content is written and synced to a temporary file
//     beside the path (local.Stage).
//  2. Under the lock, check runs, and the file is read again. If it still
//     holds exactly what change saw, the temporary is renamed over it: the
//     commit point, which every other holder of the lock sees atomically,
//     just as it saw the whole read-modify-write before. If another writer
//     changed it meanwhile, the temporary is discarded and the next attempt
//     computes from the new content.
//  3. After the lock is released, and before this returns, the directory is
//     synced, making the rename durable.
//
// The comparison is on content, not on a token or file identity: change is
// a function of the content alone, so a file changed and changed back yields
// the same write. That keeps every guarantee the lock gave. A hook landing
// while the collector publishes still gets a fresh token (saveRequest), so
// CompleteRequest leaves its evidence pending; and a forget under the lock
// cannot slip between a writer's registration check and its write, because
// check runs under the lock right before the rename.
//
// Between the rename and the directory sync, another holder of the lock can
// read the new file before it is durable. The writer has not returned yet,
// so it has promised nothing: a crash then can undo the rename, as it could
// undo a write that never finished, and what that reader did with the
// content (the collector publishing a hook's evidence, retention keeping a
// session) was still correct for content that existed. A reader never sees
// a partial file, as the temporary is synced before it is renamed.
//
// A writer committing back to back would beat every staged attempt of
// another (a stress run with the collector writing continuously lost hook
// writes that way). So a hook (ForHook), whose write cannot be retried, is
// overtaken at most once: its next attempt holds the lock from its read
// through its rename, and so across the temporary file's sync. Any other
// writer never syncs under the lock; after unlockedWriteAttempts it returns
// errWriteOvertaken for its caller to retry. The directory sync always waits
// until the lock is released.
//
// change may run more than once, so it must compute only from its argument
// and the caller's inputs, and record its results afresh on every run.
// write false leaves the file as it is; check still runs under the lock and
// the file must still be unchanged, so a decision not to write is as atomic
// as a write. An error from change or check is returned as is, with nothing
// written.
