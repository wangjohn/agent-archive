// Outstanding is what one registered session still owes the bucket, as local
// state records it. It is the one definition of a "pending" session: status,
// setup's destination guard, uninstall's warning, backfill's upload progress
// and history, the collector's scan journal, and retention's expiry deferral
// all read it through Store.Outstanding, and none re-derives it from the
// files underneath (a guard test in this package enforces that).
//
// The facets are what the files say; the methods are the questions callers
// ask of them:
//
//   - Owed: work the collector will do on its next pass. A queued request, an
//     interrupted scan, a publication built and not yet accepted by storage
//     (in flight, or held back by the upload interval), or a cached
//     candidate still waiting for that interval. Evidence exists locally
//     that is not in the bucket yet.
//   - Pending: Owed, or a session never captured at all. This is the count
//     users see as "pending".
//   - SyncCanFinish: Pending, less a session only waiting for its
//     transcript, which nothing a sync does can publish.
//
// A recorded capture gap (Blocked) or a policy decline is not owed work: the
// collector has done everything it can until the source changes. A session
// the configuration no longer publishes is the caller's to leave out (see
// config.Config.AcceptSession); Outstanding does not read the configuration.
type Outstanding struct {
	// Requested: a hook or import request is queued and not yet
	// acknowledged. The caller supplies it (see QueuedRequests), since every
	// caller lists the requests once for all sessions.
	Requested bool
	// Scan: a scan was journaled (SetScanPending) and never completed.
	Scan bool
	// Upload: a publication was built and storage has not accepted it yet,
	// in flight or held back by the upload interval (the pending/ file).
	Upload bool
	// RateLimited: the cached candidate differs from the last publication
	// and waits for the upload interval.
	RateLimited bool
	// NeverCaptured: nothing is cached for the session: it has never been
	// captured, not even as a gap or a decline.
	NeverCaptured bool
	// WaitingForTranscript: the session reads a transcript file, has no path
	// to one yet, has never published, and has no publication in flight. A
	// Cursor chat whose transcript never arrived (transcripts turned off) is
	// the case: nothing of it can be published anywhere until a path does.
	// A Cursor database chat has no path by design and never waits.
	WaitingForTranscript bool
	// Blocked: the cached state is a recorded capture gap.
	Blocked bool
	// Published: a publication of the session was ever recorded.
	Published bool
