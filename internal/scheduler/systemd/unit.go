// The unit files are written and read here and nowhere else. A unit file is
// the INI-like syntax of systemd.syntax(7), and three of its rules decide
// what a value must look like to survive a round trip:
//
//   - a `%` in any value starts a specifier (%h, %t...), so it is written
//     doubled (`%%`);
//   - ExecStart= expands `$VAR` and `${VAR}` in its arguments, so a `$` there
//     is written doubled (`$$`); Environment= does not expand ("the `$`
//     character has no special meaning", systemd.exec(5)). The program's
//     path is not expanded but the argv[0] made from it is ("the program to
//     execute may not be a variable", systemd.service(5)), so a program
//     whose path has a `$` is refused rather than written in a way that
//     does not run what it names;
//   - Environment= and ExecStart= split their value into words on white
//     space, honoring single and double quotes and C-style backslash
//     escapes, so a word with anything but the plainest characters is
//     written in double quotes, with `\` and `"` escaped. A program's path
//     is the exception: systemd refuses one with a quote or a backslash in
//     it, however it is written ("Executable name contains special
//     characters", load-fragment.c), so Plan refuses it too.
//
// StandardOutput=append: takes the rest of the line as a path, with only its
// specifiers expanded, so a path is written as it is with `%` doubled.
// Control characters and text that is not valid UTF-8 are refused (a unit
// file is UTF-8, one setting to a line); a collector has no use for them.
