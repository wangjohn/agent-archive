# CLI performance baselines

The synthetic benchmarks measure current reader/command work without real
credentials, transcripts, native applications or a bucket. They change no
production command behavior. Run from the repository root with the toolchain in go.mod (Go 1.27.2):

```sh
go test ./internal/reader ./internal/cli -run '^$' -bench 'Benchmark(ReaderScale|CommandScale)$' -benchtime=1x -count=2
go test ./internal/reader ./internal/cli -run '^$' -bench 'Benchmark(ReaderLatency|CommandLatency|UsableTerminalScreen|CommandReads)$' -benchtime=1x -count=2
```

Use a private `GOCACHE` and `GOTMPDIR` when running from an isolated checkout.
Run timings serially on an otherwise idle host. These benchmarks report costs;
they do not enforce wall-clock thresholds in CI. `-benchtime=1x` keeps the full
50k filesystem matrix practical; repeat with `-count` to see timing variance.

`BenchCase` covers 800, 10k and 50k sessions, limits 1, 50 and 0 (all), and
cold/warm/changed caches. Synthetic metadata uses pinned timestamps and 100
projects, one placeholder source header per session, and complete v3 revision
summaries. No source is downloaded. Cold cases start with an empty private
cache. Warm cases prepare precisely the selected cache. Changed cases warm the
original revision, then replace every sidecar and add its new revision summary;
the old summaries remain, as they may after publication. Every iteration starts
from the same two generations. Fixture construction, warmup and mutation are
outside timed/allocation measurements.

Reader and command scale operations include opening the metadata cache. Reader
cases additionally report `cacheOpen-ns/op`; their total includes that span.
Command cases call `Run` with injected `Env` and include flags, config loading,
store opening, cache work, discovery, downloads and JSON rendering to a discard
writer. They exclude OS process execution, credential lookup and real network
transport. Limits select by capture time; limit 0 exercises exhaustive fallback.

`MeasuredStore` retains versioned GET, bounded GET, paged/ranged LIST and Stat
capabilities. LIST/GET counters count attempted calls, including failed or
cancelled reads; GET bytes count returned body bytes. LIST header bytes are key
and ETag lengths plus 16 bytes for size/time per object, an explicit estimate
that excludes provider serialization, HTTP and TLS. Peak reads includes both
LIST and GET; Stat is forwarded but not counted. Delay applies independently to
each LIST/GET and honors cancellation. Small latency cases use 80 sessions,
limit 50 and 1 ms/request; they separate injected waits from zero-delay CPU and
filesystem scale costs. MemoryStore sorting/copying costs remain in both.

The command-read cases cover an exact summary, a parent with 50 direct children,
a short ID summary and one-day stats over 800 synthetic sessions. The stats
case spreads capture times evenly over 90 days (about 1/90 in the current
window), 100 projects, and one gpt-5 token attribution per session with varying
input/output counts. It includes no parent relationships or skill/tool usage;
those richer compute workloads have separate stats benchmarks. The listing
matrix itself spans less than 14 hours and has no token/model counts. The first
usable screen case covers cold interactive stats on an injected 80x24 terminal;
it records the completed first full-frame write and then quits through fake
keys. It includes data loading, stats computation and rendering, but does not
measure emulator painting or process startup. Browser list startup, real
provider latency, live archive targets and platform acceptance require separate
validation; no synthetic run establishes them.

The initial baseline uses production main at `d914dfb2391dd5f8b18b2d182b17bf6f4269e256`
(2026-10-07), including the history/lazy-inventory changes. Compare later PRs on
the same fixtures and machine. Warm list-50 should retain zero GETs; bounded
list-50 reads 50 selected sidecars, while narrow stats and short-ID lookup
currently require exhaustive bodies. Timing/allocation snapshots are supporting
local evidence, not provider guarantees. The [implementation plan](../proposals/cli-performance.md)
tracks subsequent optimizations.

Initial local execution recorded content-free counters on native Darwin/amd64.
Bounded cold/changed list-50 used 50 GETs; warm used zero. Exact show used four
attempted GETs (including unavailable harness probes). The short-ID path used
804 GETs and two LISTs for 800 sessions. Cold stats and its first usable screen
used 800 GETs. The full matrix was attempted, but repeated exhaustive cache
cleanup became prohibitively slow in `unlinkat`; the partial 10k exhaustive
warm sample still showed zero GETs and 50 ranged LISTs. Full 10k/50k cache
coverage remained pending after that initial run. Concurrent local validation
caused material timing variance, so these wall-time samples are not accepted as
controlled baselines.
Use the commands above on an idle host before assessing speed improvements.
`BenchmarkReaderExhaustiveNoCache` supplies a cheap additional cardinality/read
check at 10k and 50k without claiming filesystem-cache coverage.

A subsequent run at the same pinned head completed all 27 reader and 27 command
scale cases, including 10k/50k exhaustive cold/warm/changed disk caches, plus
latency, first-screen and command-read cases. This closes the matrix execution
coverage gap. Unrelated CPU race tests and temporary cleanup overlapped that
run, so its wall times still carry an external-contention limitation. They do
not establish idle-host, live-provider or real-terminal acceptance.
