# `agent-archive handoff` — engineering spec

Status: implemented (PRs H1–H3). Written 2026-09-22 from a probe of real
Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor transcripts run through filter 3 / parser
0.6.0; the versions named below are those of the time (see
[versions](../maintainers/versions.md) for today's). How to use it:
[handoff guide](../../docs/guides/handoff.md).

## Problem

A person switching coding agents mid-task (Codex → Claude Code, Claude Code
→ Cursor, or the same agent on another machine) has no way to carry the
conversation over. Each app resumes only its own sessions, from its own
local files. Today the closest path is `agent-archive show ID --normalized`,
which prints ~350 KB of JSON for a medium Claude session, omits every tool
result's text, and has no "the session I was just in" selector.

The archive already does the hard part. On the probe:

| Session | Raw transcript | Normalized JSON | Rendered handoff (prototype) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Code, 19 prompts, 117 tool calls | 7.0 MB | 353 KB | 102 KB |
| Codex, 6 prompts, 18 tool calls | 406 KB | 14 KB | 6 KB |
| Cursor, 78 tool calls | 130 KB | 148 KB | 63 KB |

The filter strips injected instructions and credentials, and the three
harnesses normalize to one shape. What is missing is a command that selects
a session, renders it as a prompt another agent can act on, and fits a
context budget.

## Goals

1. One command produces a handoff document for any archived session, from
   any of the three harnesses, readable by any of them.
2. `--latest` finds "the session I was just in" for the current project
   without the user copying an ID.
3. Same machine: works immediately, without waiting for a collector pass or
   an upload, and while collection is paused.
4. Across machines: works from the bucket alone.
5. Output fits a byte budget by eliding the least useful content first,
   never the person's prompts or the last exchanges.
6. Nothing leaves the privacy filter's guarantees: every rendered byte comes
   from filtered records.

## Non-goals

- Converting a transcript into another harness's native, resumable session
  file. That format is private, versioned per app, and fragile to forge.
  The receiving agent starts a new session with the handoff as context.
- Moving or inspecting workspace state. Uncommitted changes stay on the
  source machine. Reading the current directory's `origin` and branch runs
  `git` through a bounded helper (`internal/gitremote`, 500 ms, best effort);
  nothing else about the workspace is inspected (see
  [Workspace section](#workspace-section)).
- Summarizing with an LLM. The output is deterministic rendering; the
  receiving agent does its own summarizing.
- Historical import. `agent-archive backfill` imports sessions the archive
  never captured; until then they are only reachable through `--file` on the
  machine that has them.

## Command

```
agent-archive handoff [SESSION_ID | --latest] [flags]
```

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `SESSION_ID` | — | Archive session ID from `list`. Mutually exclusive with `--latest` and `--file`. |
| `--latest` | off | Most recent session for the project (see [Selection](#selection)). |
| `--project DIR\|NAME` | current directory | The project the picker and a title look at first (a directory's repository, or a project name), and the directory `--latest` searches, matched by its path and, when it is in a repository with an `origin` remote, by that repository (see [Matching by repository](#matching-by-repository)). See [session finding](session-finding.md#3-scope-this-repository-first). |
| `--all-projects` | off | The picker and a title look at every project, not only the working directory's repository. Not with `--project`, `--latest`, or `--file`. |
| `--harness NAME` | any | Restrict `--latest`, or disambiguate an ID, to `claude`, `codex`, or `cursor`. |
| `--file PATH --harness NAME` | — | Render a native transcript file directly. Same machine only; still filtered. |
| `--source auto\|local\|archive` | `auto` | Where the session content comes from (see [Content source](#content-source)). |
| `--max-bytes N` | `120000` | Output budget in bytes (≈30k tokens). `0` means no limit. When the budget trims anything, the untrimmed version is also saved (see [Full version](#full-version-when-trimmed)). |
| `--format markdown\|json` | `markdown` | `json` emits the structured `Handoff` document before rendering. |
| `--output FILE` | stdout | Write to a file created with mode `0600`. Refuses to overwrite an existing file. |
| `--force` | off | With `--output`, overwrite an existing file. |
| `--no-preamble` | off | Omit the instructions addressed to the receiving agent. |

Exit codes follow `show`: 0 success, 1 runtime failure, 2 usage error. When
setup has never run, the command prints the shared `notSetUpMessage` to
stderr and exits 1, except with `--file`, which needs no setup.

Documented recipes (help text and `docs/guides/handoff.md`):

```sh
# Continue in Claude Code what you started in Codex, same repo
claude "$(agent-archive handoff --latest --harness codex)"

# Continue in Codex
codex "$(agent-archive handoff --latest --harness claude)"

# Large session, or an agent without a prompt argument: write a file
agent-archive handoff --latest --output /tmp/handoff.md
# then tell the agent: "Read /tmp/handoff.md and continue the work"
```

macOS `ARG_MAX` is 1 MB, so the default budget is safe as a command
argument.

## Selection

How the picker and title search find a session (scope, native names,
filtering) is planned in [session-finding.md](session-finding.md).

An explicit `SESSION_ID` resolves as `show` does: the local registration
first when `--source` allows it, otherwise `locateMetadataKey`.

`--latest` resolves in this order and prints the choice on stderr
(`handoff: using codex session 7f3c… captured 4 minutes ago`) so a wrong
pick is visible:

1. **Local registrations.** `collector.OpenLocalStoreReadOnly(home)` then
   `LoadRegistrations()`. Keep registrations that match the project by path
   or by repository, match `--harness`, and exclude subagent registrations
   (`ParentSessionID != ""`). *By path:* `ProjectRoot` equals the project
   directory or contains it (compared with and without symlinks resolved; a
   root inside the directory does not count, so running from ~ does not
   match every project). *By repository:* the registration's `repo_key`
   equals the current directory's
   ([Matching by repository](#matching-by-repository)). Order by the transcript file's
   modification time, falling back to `RegisteredAt`, and take the first
   that yields a bundle with a prompt: a session with no transcript yet, an
   unreadable or oversized one, or one that has only just started is passed
   over, never allowed to stop the search. This is what makes a
   same-machine switch immediate.

   Run inside an agent, the newest session is the one running the command.
   `--latest` skips any session whose native ID the environment names:
   `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` (observed in Claude Code) and `CODEX_THREAD_ID`
   (read if present, not yet observed). An explicit ID is always honored.
2. **Archive.** If no local registration matches (another machine, or
   `--source archive`), list metadata with `reader.ListMetadataWithOptions`
   and keep sidecars whose `ProjectID` is one of the current directory's
   (the same path) or whose `repo_key` equals its key (the same repository),
   ordered by `CapturedAt`. Exclude sessions with a `ParentSessionID`.
3. If still nothing matches, exit 1. The message names what was searched
   and, when the archive holds any sessions, lists the five most recent
   non-subagent ones (filtered by `--harness` when given) so one can be
   picked without a separate `list`:

   ```
   agent-archive: handoff: no session for /work/widget on this machine or in the archive.
   Tried this directory's repository (its remote origin), then its path. A session
   matches when it ran in a checkout of the same origin or at this path. Recent archived sessions:
     codex   12 minutes ago  another machine  agent-archive handoff 7f3c…
     claude  2 hours ago     this machine     agent-archive handoff 91ab…
     …
   ```

   When the directory has no key (not in a git repository with a remote
   named `origin`), the message says only the path was tried and that
   matching by repository needs that remote.

   Rows show only metadata (harness, `CapturedAt` as a relative time, and
   whether `MachineID` equals this machine's), so the fallback keeps the
   rule that listing never prints transcript content. `list` itself gains
   no project column in v1: a name taken from local config would be blank
   on the other machine, which is where it would be needed.

`ProjectID` hashes the absolute path, so on its own a second Mac matched
only when the repository was at the same path. The repository key removes
that limit for repositories with an `origin` remote; a directory without one
still matches by path only, and its cross-machine flow is step 3's fallback
list, or `list` → `handoff ID`.

### Matching by repository

Package R2 of `dev/proposals/portable-handoff-and-onboarding.md`. The key is
`archive.RepoKey` of the `origin` remote (`repo_key` in the registration and
the metadata sidecar; R1 records it).

- **The current directory's key** is asked of git for the directory itself
  (`git -C DIR config --get remote.origin.url`, bounded by
  `gitremote.Timeout`), which answers for any directory inside a checkout:
  running in `repo/pkg/x` has `repo`'s key, and running from a parent of
  several repositories has none, so it matches nothing by repository (the
  path rule's "a root inside the directory does not count" holds). Any
  failure is no key, and then matching is exactly the path rule.
- **Path matches outrank repository matches.** The search order is this
  machine's path matches (most recently active first), the archive's path
  matches (most recently captured first), this machine's repository-only
  matches, then the archive's. A repository-only candidate is considered
  only when no path match exists anywhere, so a repository-only match can
  never displace a working `--latest`: a bucket writer must not be able to
  turn one into a question or a refusal. A registration or sidecar that
  matches by path is a path match even when its key matches too. A path
  match is accepted even when the two keys differ (the remote was changed
  since). This machine's sessions are still tried before the archive's
  within each kind, so a stale local session hides a newer one from another
  computer; `--source archive` skips the local ones. The Cursor fallback
  (`--to` inside Cursor, which sets `--latest --harness cursor`) goes through
  the same search, so an unrelated newer clone's session cannot displace the
  calling chat's own.
- **Forks.** Only `origin` is read. A fork's `origin` is the fork, which
  differs from upstream's, so the two do not match.
- **The key is a convenience, not authentication, and a repository-only
  match must be accepted by a person.** A directory's key comes from
  `.git/config`, which whoever wrote the repository controls, and a
  session's key from a sidecar anyone with write access to the bucket can
  label; the key is also a hash of a guessable public URL. So a repository
  that names another repository's origin, or a planted session, can make
  `--latest` reach a session that matched only by repository. A path match
  cannot be steered that way by a hostile repository (it names no path of
  its own); it can be forged by a writer of the bucket, who can compute a
  project ID (a hash of a path), so the archive is trusted as far as its
  writers are. When the search reaches a repository-only match,
  `handoffResolver.acceptRepoMatch` puts it to a gate (`newRepoMatchGate`)
  before it is used. An archived session is judged from its sidecar alone:
  none of its source bundle is read until the gate passes, so a hostile
  bucket cannot make every `--latest` download a large bundle first. For a
  session on this machine the local transcript is read first (its first
  prompt is needed for the question), and nothing is printed or launched
  until the gate passes. The `handoff: using ...` line is printed only
  after the gate passes.
  - On a terminal (both stdin and stdout, with `AGENT_ARCHIVE_NONINTERACTIVE`
    off) stderr says `handoff: matched by repository (remote origin), not by
    path`, then the machine (this or another), the project name, the start
    time and the first prompt (the sidecar's `title`, or the transcript's for
    a session on this machine), each of the session's own words shown through
    `archive.DisplayLine` and cut to 60 columns, and asks `Hand off this
    session?`, default No. Nothing is printed to stdout or launched, and no
    archived source is read, before a yes.
  - Where it cannot ask (a pipe, or a coding agent's shell) it exits 1. It
    prints only the machine label and the start time (both ours) and, worded
    for the person, `Ask the user whether to use it; they can run: agent-archive
    handoff ID ...`, with the `--harness`, `--to`, and `--worktree` given (not
    `--format`, `--output`, `--max-bytes`, `--branch`, `--project`, or
    `--source`: the person adds what they want). The ID is printed only when
    it is well formed (32 lowercase hexadecimal digits, the one shape the
    program makes); an ID from a sidecar or a registration can be anything, of
    any length, so otherwise the message says `they can find it with:
    agent-archive list`. No other text from the sidecar or the transcript is
    printed there, since an agent reads it. The same rule covers the IDs in
    the `handoff: using` line and in the list of recent sessions that ends a
    failed `--latest`.
  - **That refusal is a speed bump, not a barrier.** It stops a steered agent
    from using the session by accident. An agent can still run the printed
    command, name a session ID itself, or set `AGENT_ARCHIVE_NONINTERACTIVE=0`.
  - An explicit ID is never gated: naming a session is the person's own
    choice. The picker never matches by key (it lists every session), so it
    is not gated. See the threat model in `docs/security/privacy.md`.
- **Branch.** Nothing is filtered by branch. When the session's recorded
  branch differs from the current checkout's (`git branch --show-current`,
  through `gitremote.Branch`; empty when detached), stderr says `handoff:
  session was on `feature/x`; you are on `main``, and the handoff's
  workspace section says so too. Under `--worktree` the agent starts in a new
  worktree, not in this directory, so nothing about this checkout is
  compared or said.
- **Where the session ran.** The handoff's workspace section adds `The
  recorded directory differs from your current checkout…` when the
  transcript's recorded working directory neither equals, contains, nor lies
  inside the launch directory (`HandoffOptions.Checkout`, compared without
  storing the full path: the document still names the base name only). The
  fields are `workspace.elsewhere` and `workspace.current_branch`, both
  omitted when not set; `handoff_version` stays 1.

## Content source

Both sources produce an `archive.SourceBundle`; everything after that is
shared, so the two paths cannot render differently.

- **local** — the registration exists and its `TranscriptPath` is readable.
  Open the file, run the harness's `archive.NewAdapter(name).FilterJSONL`
  (Cursor text transcripts use `FilterText`), and build the bundle in memory
  with `archive.NewSourceBundle`. Merge supplemental evidence already on
  disk from `LoadPublished`/pending requests when present, so hook-reported
  finals and models are not lost. No lock is taken, nothing is written, and
  nothing is uploaded; this read is safe while the collector runs because
  the transcript is append-only and the adapter already tolerates a torn
  last line.
- **archive** — `reader.RefreshAndLoad` on the metadata key, exactly as
  `show --normalized` does, including its `ErrRefreshRequired` message.
- **auto** — local when available, otherwise archive. Any local failure
  (missing, unreadable, oversized, or unsafe transcript) falls back to the
  archive's published copy; if that fails too, both reasons are reported.
  The header records which one was used.

A session ID is accepted only if it is made of the characters archive
session IDs use (`archive.MetadataObjectKey` validates it), because it names
local files and bucket keys.

Session times come from the transcript's own timestamps, then published
metadata (start and capture time), then what this machine knows (the
registration's start, the transcript's modification time). The time the
handoff is built is never used. A Cursor text transcript, which has role
sections rather than records, is rendered from those sections.

`--file PATH --harness NAME` is the local path without a registration: it
filters an arbitrary native transcript. It exists so a same-machine switch
works for sessions the archive declined (started before activation, resumed
old sessions, excluded projects). It never uploads and never registers.

The rendered document is built only from the filtered bundle. The raw
transcript is never read for rendering, only passed through the adapter.

## Handoff model

New file `internal/archive/handoff.go`, pure (no filesystem, network, or
clock), next to `views.go`:

```go
type HandoffOptions struct {
    MaxBytes        int  // 0 = unlimited
    ToolResultLines int  // head+tail lines kept per result before budgeting; default 12
    Preamble        bool
}

type Handoff struct {
    Session    HandoffSession     // ids, harness, models, started/captured, state, turn outcome, source
    Workspace  HandoffWorkspace   // recorded cwd basename and branch
    Plan       *HandoffPlan       // last TodoWrite / update_plan state, if any
    FilesTouched []string         // from Edit/Write/MultiEdit/apply_patch arguments, first-touch order
    Exchanges  []HandoffExchange  // one per human prompt
    LeftOff    string             // last assistant text
    Elisions   []HandoffElision   // what the budget removed, for the footer
    Gaps       []CaptureGap       // bundle capture gaps, codes and counts only
}

type HandoffExchange struct {
    Prompt    NormalizedTurn
    Steps     []HandoffStep       // assistant text and tool calls, in record order
}

type HandoffStep struct {
    Text       string             // assistant text, or ""
    Tool       *HandoffToolCall
}

type HandoffToolCall struct {
    Name, Summary string          // Summary: one line derived from arguments
    IsError       bool
    Result        string          // trimmed result text; "" when none observed
    ResultBytes   int
}

func BuildHandoff(bundle SourceBundle, meta *Metadata, opts HandoffOptions) (Handoff, error)
func RenderHandoffMarkdown(h Handoff) []byte
```

`BuildHandoff` calls `ParseNormalized`, groups turns into exchanges at each
`TurnKindHumanPrompt`, and attaches tool calls by `RecordIndex`. Turns of
every non-prompt user kind added by C1 (`harness_meta`, `command_output`,
`shell_command`, `local_command`) and by H1 below are skipped, except that a
`shell_command` renders as a step (`$ cmd`) because the person ran it.
Content before the first human prompt is attached to a synthetic first
exchange only if it has assistant text.

**Tool call summary.** One line per call, from the retained arguments:

| Tool (any harness spelling) | Summary |
|---|---|
| `Bash`, `exec_command`, `shell`, Codex `CommandExecution` | the command, first line, ≤200 chars |
| `Read`, `read_file` | path, plus range when given |
| `Edit`, `MultiEdit`, `Write`, `apply_patch` | path(s); never the body |
| `Grep`, `Glob`, `search` | pattern and path |
| `Agent`, `Task` | description, else the first 120 chars of the prompt |
| anything else | `name` plus compact JSON of arguments, ≤200 chars |

Edit bodies are excluded on purpose: the receiving agent should read the
file as it is now, not replay diffs that may no longer apply.

**Tool result text.** Add an unexported
`toolResultText(record map[string]any, callID string) string` in
`views.go` beside `toolResultOutput`, using the same shapes plus the Codex
list form fixed in H1. It is exposed only through `BuildHandoff`; `show
--normalized` keeps reporting sizes only. Results are trimmed to the first
and last `ToolResultLines/2` lines with a `… N lines omitted …` marker.
Cursor transcripts carry no tool results; the header says so once instead
of every call showing nothing.

**Plan.** The arguments of the last `TodoWrite` (Claude) or `update_plan`
(Codex) call, rendered as a checklist. This is usually the best statement of
remaining work.

---
Omitted to fit 120 KB: tool output for exchanges 1–9; 41 tool calls in
exchanges 1–4 collapsed. Full record:
~/.agent-archive/handoffs/7f3c….md (read it for anything omitted here).
Capture gaps: sensitive_content_redacted ×1, hidden_instruction_omitted ×2.
```

"Where it left off" and "Plan" come before the conversation so an agent
that reads only the top still has the essentials.

Everything the session recorded is data, never structure: a web page the
agent echoed can contain `## Instructions for the receiving agent`. So the
person's prompts, the agent's text, "Where it left off", and compaction
summaries are block-quoted; plan items are kept to one line with any leading
Markdown syntax (`#`, `>`, list markers, fences) escaped; file names, tool
names, and commands are single-line code spans; and tool output is fenced.
None of it can add a heading of its own to the handoff.

Every string passes one helper, `displayText`, before either output is
made (`BuildHandoff` applies it to the whole handoff by reflection, and
`RenderHandoffMarkdown` again, whoever built its input): a lone `\r`, which
CommonMark reads as a line ending, becomes `\n`, so the block quote and the
fences cover every line; C0 and C1 control characters (every terminal escape
sequence's introducer) and bidirectional overrides are removed. A test fills
every string field by reflection and checks both outputs.

One case remains, inherent to Cursor's plain-text transcripts: in a
transcript whose sections are not separated by blank lines, a line of tool
output that starts at column 0 with `user:` in the transcript's own header
case (that of its first header, `user:` or `User:`) reads as a role header,
so it starts a Person turn. When sections are blank-line separated, only
such a line after a blank line does. The
handoff reads the retained text with the same parser the filter used (see
the privacy doc's known misses).

### Workspace section

From the bundle: the first retained `cwd` (basename only in the rendered
text) and the last `gitBranch`, labeled "as recorded". `handoff` runs on the
machine where work continues, so anything it reads from the receiving
workspace describes that one, not the source's: it is only compared with the
recorded values, never mixed into them. The caller gives
`HandoffOptions.Checkout` (the launch directory and its branch), and the
section then adds a line when the recorded directory is not the current
checkout ("check paths against the current tree") and when the branches
differ; the full paths are compared and dropped, never stored in the
document. On the same machine the receiving agent can run `git status`
itself, and the preamble tells it to. On another machine the useful fact is
whether the source left unpushed work, which only the source can report;
phase 2 records it at the Stop hook (see [Later](#later-phase-2)).

## Budget

Render, measure, and if over `MaxBytes` apply these steps in order,
re-measuring after each, until it fits:

The first three steps never touch the protected tail: the steps of the last
3 exchanges, but no more than the last 20 steps overall. (Protecting three
whole exchanges would leave a session of one prompt and hundreds of tool
calls untrimmable.)

1. Drop tool result text, oldest first.
2. Collapse tool-call lines to a count (``- 14 tool calls: `Bash` ×9, `Read` ×5``)
   at the position of the first collapsed call, oldest first.
3. Replace assistant text with its first 300 chars, oldest first. "Where it
   left off" is never shortened.
4. Truncate person prompts longer than 2,000 chars to their first 2,000,
   oldest first. Prompts are never dropped.
5. If still over, emit it anyway and warn on stderr with the final size.

Each step appends a `HandoffElision` so the footer states what was removed.
The budget counts the whole document including preamble and footer.

### Full version when trimmed

When any budget step ran, the CLI also renders the same `Handoff` with no
budget and writes it to
`<AGENT_ARCHIVE_HOME>/handoffs/<archive-session-id>.md` (for `--file`, the
native session ID's SHA-256 prefix stands in for the archive ID). The
trimmed document's footer names that path and tells the agent to read it
for anything omitted. This makes the budget decide what the agent reads up
front, not what it can reach.

- The directory is `0700` and the file `0600`, written atomically with
  `local.WriteBytes`. A later handoff of the same session replaces it.
- Contents are the same filtered rendering, so the privacy guarantees are
  unchanged; it simply is not trimmed.
- The receiving agent is always on the machine where `handoff` ran, so the
  path resolves for it in both same-machine and cross-machine use.
- Files older than 7 days are deleted at the start of every `handoff` run
  and on each collector pass. `uninstall --delete-local-data` removes the
  directory once `handoffs` is in its `localStateEntries` allowlist
  (without that, uninstall reports it as an unknown leftover).
- Nothing is saved when the output was not trimmed, or with
  `--max-bytes 0`. A failure to save warns on stderr, drops the footer
  line, and still emits the trimmed document.
- `--format json` saves the untrimmed JSON with a `.json` extension.

## Prerequisite parser and filter fixes (PR H1)

Found by the probe; none are in C1's or C4's scope. Bumps to filter 6 /
adapter 0.6.0 / parser 0.9.0 (C4 took filter 5 / parser 0.8.0 first).

1. **Codex list-shaped tool output.** `function_call_output.output` and
   `custom_tool_call_output.output` are lists of `{type: input_text, text}`
   blocks in current Codex. `toolResultOutput` handles only strings, so every
   Codex result reports `output_bytes: 0` today. Fall back to `contentText`
   on a list. Fixture: two outputs from a real rollout, hand-sanitized.
2. **Claude harness notifications counted as prompts.** Claude Code writes
   background-task completions as user records with
   `origin: {kind: "task-notification"}` and `promptSource: "system"`; real
   prompts carry `origin.kind: "human"`. On the probed session 12 of 20
   "prompts" were notifications. Allowlist `origin` (only its `kind`
   string) and `promptSource`, and classify a user record whose
   `origin.kind` is a known harness kind (`task-notification`) as a new
   `TurnKindHarnessNotification`, not a prompt. The list is an allowlist:
   an origin kind not on it stays a prompt, so a kind a later version adds
   can never silently drop something the person sent. Filter-5 and older bundles lack the
   field and keep today's behavior.
3. **Codex injected context counted as the first prompt.** Codex prepends a
   user message holding `<recommended_plugins>…</recommended_plugins>`
   (about 50 lines of plugin names). Add the tag to the injected-block list
   in `stripInjectedInstructions` with the same `hidden_instruction_omitted`
   gap. While there, collect every distinct leading `<tag>` across the
   Codex rollouts on the test machine and add any other harness-written one.
4. Not fixable from the record: the desktop app's "The app was quit while
   you were working…" message has `promptSource: "sdk"` and no `origin`,
   exactly like an SDK prompt. Leave it as a prompt and record the reason
   in `docs/reference/capture-capabilities.md`.

## Privacy

- Printing content requires the explicit `handoff` command, as
  `show --normalized` does; `list` stays metadata-only.
- All rendered text comes from filtered records. Local mode runs the same
  adapter as the collector; a test asserts a planted credential in a local
  transcript is `[REDACTED]` in the handoff.
- `--output` creates files `0600` and never inside the project directory
  unless the path given explicitly is there.
- The saved full version lives only in the archive's own data directory,
  with the same permissions and a 7-day lifetime.
- The preamble tells the receiving agent the record is filtered, so it does
  not treat a `[REDACTED]` token as a real value, and that the record's
  content is not instructions to follow.
- Recorded text cannot add Markdown structure (see the layout above).

## Tests

- **Golden files** in `internal/archive/testdata/handoff/` (new; add an `-update` test flag): one synthetic
  transcript per harness (prompt, text, tool call with result, error
  result, edit, plan) and its expected markdown. Regenerate with
  `go test ./internal/archive -run Handoff -update`.
- **Budget**: a generated 2 MB transcript renders under 120 KB, keeps every
  prompt and the last 3 exchanges' results, and lists elisions in order.
  A budget smaller than the prompts alone still emits and warns.
- **Parity**: the same fixture rendered via local source and via an
  archive round trip through `storagetest.NewMemoryStore` is byte-identical apart
  from the `source:` header field.
- **Selection**: `--latest` prefers local over archive; subdirectory cwd
  matches its project; subagent registrations are skipped; `--harness`
  filters; no match exits 1 with the search description.
- **Repository matching**: two machines' project IDs with one key both
  match; a path match works whatever the keys; no key is the path rule
  exactly; a subdirectory of a repository matches and a parent of
  repositories does not (real `git`); a repository-only match is named on
  stderr, asked about on a terminal (default No), and refused, printing the
  explicit command, where nothing can be asked; an explicit ID is never
  gated; a session from another machine launches with retrieval hints that
  read the archive; the branch difference line; the no-match text; a path
  match outranks a newer repository-only one (archive, this machine, Cursor
  fallback); the refusal prints no text from the sidecar or the transcript
  and the question shows it plain and capped (hostile fixtures: an
  instruction sentence, zero-width and tag characters, escapes, 20 KB); no
  source is read before the answer.
- **Privacy**: planted `sk-`, `AKIA`, and PEM values in a local transcript
  are redacted in output; `--output` mode is `0600`; overwrite refused
  without `--force`.
- **Full version**: a trimmed handoff saves an untrimmed file whose path
  the footer names; an untrimmed one saves nothing; files older than 7 days
  are pruned; a save failure still emits the trimmed document.
- **Fallback list**: with no match, the error lists at most five recent
  sessions, marks this machine versus another, and contains no transcript
  text.
- **H1**: fixtures for each of the three fixes, and parser-version gating
  so filter-5 and older bundles classify as before.
- **Live check** (not CI): with the recipe in the local e2e notes, publish
  copies of one real transcript per harness to MinIO, run
  `handoff ID --source archive` and `handoff --file PATH`, and paste each
  into the other two agents. Record whether each agent correctly states the
  task and the next step. This is the acceptance criterion that matters.

## Sequencing

1. **C1** (`fix/prompt-accuracy`, in progress in another session) merges
   first. It rewrites the user-turn classification in `views.go` that H1
   and H2 extend; starting before it lands means a painful rebase.
2. **H1** — parser/filter fixes above. Implementer B's track.
3. **H2** — `internal/archive/handoff.go` with golden and budget tests.
   Pure; can start in parallel with H1 against C1's branch, rebasing onto
   H1 before review.
4. **H3** — `internal/cli/handoff.go`, selection and fallback list, local
   source, full-version save, help, docs.

Each PR follows the existing review process in
`docs/agent-archive-review-fix-plan.md`.

## Later (phase 2)

- ~~**Portable repository key**~~ shipped: see
  [Matching by repository](#matching-by-repository).
- **Source workspace state at stop.** The Stop hook records the current
  commit and a count of uncommitted files as supplemental evidence (counts
  only, never names). The handoff then warns "the source left 3 uncommitted
  files at a1b2c3; they are not on this machine" when it matters.
- **Project name and filter for `list`.** With the repository key, record
  the project directory's basename in metadata, add `list --project`, and
  document the new field in `docs/security/privacy.md`.
- `--include-subagents`: render linked child sessions as nested sections.
- `--since-prompt N`: hand off only the tail of a long session.
- `handoff --copy` to put the output on the clipboard via `pbcopy`.

## Decisions

Settled 2026-09-22.

1. **Budget stays 120 KB** (≈30k tokens), and the untrimmed version is
   always saved when anything is trimmed.
2. **No `git` in v1.** The workspace line shows only the recorded branch
   and directory; recording source-side state at the Stop hook is phase 2.
   (Since superseded for reads: `--latest` asks git for the current
   directory's origin key and the launch directory's branch, both bounded and
   best effort, and recording source-side state is still not done.)
3. **No project column in `list` for v1.** `--latest` lists recent sessions
   when it finds no match; a portable repository key and a project name in
   metadata are phase 2.

## Direct handoff v2

Planned 2026-09-29. Goal: continuing a session in another agent takes one
command and no copying. #132 (picker) and #136 (`--to`) are the base.

**Status: implemented.** 0 in #146, A in #150, B in #151, C in #147, D in
#163, E in #162, F in #152, and G (docs) in the PR that adds this line.
What shipped differs from the plan below in the ways listed under
[Deviations](#deviations); the rest is as written.

### Target experience

```text
$ agent-archive handoff
  (picker: local sessions, including ones not yet uploaded, and archived ones)
  Continue in:  [1] Codex (default)  [2] Claude Code  [3] Cursor  [p] print  [c] copy  [w] write file
handoff: launching codex in ~/src/app
```

Inside an agent, `/handoff codex` runs `agent-archive handoff --to codex`,
which hands off *that* session and opens Codex in a new terminal tab.

### Behavior

1. **Selection (A).** The handoff picker merges this machine's top-level
   registrations with top-level archived rows, joined on
   `ArchiveSessionID`; a local row wins and is marked "not yet uploaded"
   when the archive lacks it.
   Sessions with no prompt yet are hidden. When the archive cannot be
   read (not set up for storage, offline), the picker shows local rows
   and says why archived ones are missing. With `--to` and no selector:
   if a variable in `currentSessionEnv` (`CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`,
   `CODEX_THREAD_ID`) names a registered session, that session is used
   without asking; if `CURSOR_AGENT` is set (Cursor exposes no session
   ID), `--latest --harness cursor` for the working directory is used;
   otherwise a terminal gets the picker and a non-terminal gets the
   existing usage error (exit 2). `--to` no longer forces `--source local`,
   and `validateHandoffLaunchOptions` no longer rejects `--to` with
   `--source archive`: an archived bundle is filtered like a local one,
   and the preamble still applies.
2. **Launch (B).** The launch copy of the handoff is written to
   `<data dir>/handoffs/launch-<name>-<unix>-<random>/handoff.md`, where
   `<name>` is the file component `handoffFullPath` uses (directory 0700
   created with `os.MkdirTemp`, so two launches in the same second get
   separate directories and no existing name, symlink included, is reused;
   file 0600 created with `O_EXCL`). Each launch has its own directory so Claude's
   `--add-dir` exposes no other saved handoff. `pruneHandoffs` removes
   `launch-*` directories older than 7 days by the directory's mtime, and
   `uninstall --delete-local-data` already covers `handoffs/`; it is never
   removed early, so a resumed session can still read it. Without a data directory (`--file` before setup) it goes
   to a private `os.MkdirTemp` directory, also never removed early (a
   resumed session may read it again) and left for the OS to clean. The child's
   environment drops the calling agent's session variables
   (`handoffSessionEnv`, an explicit list, never a prefix: settings such as
   `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK` must survive). It includes every
   `currentSessionEnv` entry, `CURSOR_AGENT` (else a Codex child would
   later look like Cursor to step 1), and `CLAUDECODE` /
   `CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT`. Arguments after `--` go to the agent. The
   binary is resolved to an absolute path with `Env.LookPath`. The prompt
   is always the last argument, after a `--` (Claude's `--add-dir` takes a
   variadic list that would otherwise swallow it). Claude Code's help
   (`Usage: claude [options] [command] [prompt]`, commander) and Codex's
   source (clap, `prompt: Option<String>` positional) end options at `--`;
   Cursor's `agent` is closed source and was not verified, so its prompt
   is last without a `--`. A `--` among the extra arguments is refused;
   an option left without its value at the end of them would take the
   `--` (or Cursor's prompt) as its value, which cannot be detected
   without knowing each agent's options, so the guide tells users to give
   every option its value. Per agent:
   - Claude Code: `claude --add-dir <launch dir> [extra] -- <prompt>`, run
     in the directory. Without `--add-dir` the read is refused (verified).
   - Codex: `codex --cd <dir> [extra] -- <prompt>`; every sandbox mode can
     read the whole disk.
   - Cursor: `agent` (else `cursor-agent`) `--workspace <dir> [extra] <prompt>`.

   `config.Handoff` may set per-agent default arguments and a default
   destination per source harness; there are no built-in extra flags.
   B replaces the body of today's `launchPreparedHandoff` with
   `writeLaunchHandoff` + `prepareLaunch` so its new functions are reached
   from `main` in B's own PR (see the `deadcode` note below).
3. **Where it runs (C, D).** When stdin and stdout are terminals the agent
   runs in this terminal, as today. Otherwise (called from inside an
   agent) it opens without asking in a new window: a new tmux window when
   `$TMUX` is set, else a new tab in iTerm2 / Terminal.app / Ghostty chosen
   by `$TERM_PROGRAM`, else a new Terminal.app window; the command returns
   after it opens. `--here` and `--new-window` force either. When no
   terminal can be opened (`termlaunch.ErrNoTerminal`: not macOS and no
   `$TMUX`), the command exits 1 naming the launch copy's path and the
   command to run in a terminal; it never runs the agent without one.
4. **Destination prompt (D).** With no `--to` on a terminal, after a
   session is chosen: numbered installed agents (default: the configured
   default, else Claude → Codex, Codex → Claude, Cursor → Claude), `p`
   print (the old behavior; the pager when long), `c` copy (`pbcopy`),
   `w` write to a file. A pipe or `--output` keeps today's behavior
   byte for byte, so `codex "$(agent-archive handoff --latest)"` still
   works.
5. **Worktree and active source (E).** `--worktree` creates
   `git worktree add -b <branch> <repo>-handoff-<short id> HEAD` beside
   the checkout (`--branch NAME`, default `handoff/<short id>`), carries
   uncommitted changes with `git stash create` in the checkout +
   `git stash apply <sha>` in the new worktree (never touching the stash
   stack or the original checkout; an empty `stash create` means nothing
   to carry; untracked files from `git ls-files --others
   --exclude-standard -z` are copied with their modes, so ignored files
   such as `.env` and `node_modules` are not), and launches there. An
   existing branch or directory of that name is an error, never reused. Without `--worktree`, if the
   source session was active in the last 2 minutes in the same checkout,
   a terminal is asked `Continue in the same checkout? [y/N/w]` (w = new
   worktree); a non-terminal gets a stderr warning and proceeds.
6. **In-agent command (F).** Custom commands are now skills in all three
   agents. Setup installs a `handoff` skill by default:
   `~/.claude/skills/handoff/SKILL.md` when Claude Code is set up and
   `~/.agents/skills/handoff/SKILL.md` when Codex or Cursor is (both read
   it). The skill tells the agent to run
   `<absolute agent-archive> handoff --to <destination>` with the
   destination the person named (default: another agent than itself), and
   for Claude Code sets `disable-model-invocation: true` and
   `allowed-tools` for that command only. Setup writes it as a
   `hooks.Change` in the setup journal, so a failed setup rolls it back.
   The journal is deleted once setup commits, so it is not what later
   commands read: a file at that path is setup's when it carries the
   marker line every rendering has, and this installation's when its
   command names the same `AGENT_ARCHIVE_HOME` (none for the default
   installation), which a relocated installation's skill sets as its hooks
   do. Setup replaces only such a file; uninstall removes only such a
   file; status lists them, and reports one whose text differs from what
   this release renders as out of date. Any other file at that path (the
   person's own, one they edited and unmarked, or another installation's)
   is left alone and reported. The installer is `internal/agentskills`: it
   installs a registry of skills, of which `handoff` is one, with its text
   in `internal/agentskills/skills/handoff/SKILL.md.tmpl`. It was
   `internal/agentcommands` when this package landed; the plan for the
   registry and the other skills is [agent-skill.md](agent-skill.md).

### Shared names

Packages rely on these; change them only in this section first.

| Owner | Name |
|---|---|
| A `handoff_select.go` | `selectHandoffSession(env handoffSelectDependencies, home string, opts handoffOptions, stdin io.Reader, stdout, stderr io.Writer) (sessionID, harness string, selected bool, code int)`; `currentHandoffSession(env, home, opts) (sessionID string, ok bool, err error)` |
| B `handoff_agents.go` | `type launchSpec struct { Destination handoffDestination; Binary string; Args []string; Dir string; Env []string; HandoffFile string }` (`Args` excludes the binary; `Env` is the child's full environment; `HandoffFile` is the launch copy, for D's `ScriptDir` and no-terminal message); `buildLaunchSpec(dest handoffDestination, prompt, handoffFile, dir string, extra []string, env launchSpecDependencies) (launchSpec, error)`; `handoffSessionEnv []string` |
| B `handoff_launch.go` | `writeLaunchHandoff(home, tempDir string, target handoffTarget, content []byte, now time.Time) (path string, err error)`; `prepareLaunch(...) (launchSpec, error)`; `Env.LaunchHandoff func(spec launchSpec, stdin io.Reader, stdout, stderr io.Writer) error` (replaces today's `func(name, cwd, prompt string, ...)` field and the matching `launchHandoff` method in `handoffCommandDependencies`); `Env.LookPath func(string) (string, error)` |
| B `internal/config` | `Config.Handoff HandoffConfig` (`json:"handoff,omitzero"`: `omitempty` never omits a struct): `Args map[string][]string`, `DefaultTo map[string]string` |
| C `internal/termlaunch` | `type Spec struct { Dir string; Argv []string; Unset []string; ScriptDir string }`; `type Environment struct { OS platform.OS; LookupEnv func(string) (string, bool); Run func(ctx context.Context, name string, args ...string) error }`; `Open(ctx, spec, env) (where string, err error)`; `ErrNoTerminal` |
| D `handoff_destination.go` | `chooseDestination(p *prompter, installed []handoffDestination, def handoffDestination) (handoffChoice, error)`; `Env.OpenTerminal func(termlaunch.Spec) (string, error)`; `Env.Clipboard func([]byte) error` |
| E `handoff_worktree.go` | `prepareLaunchDir(env worktreeDependencies, opts handoffOptions, target handoffTarget, dir string, stdin, answers io.Reader, stderr io.Writer) (string, error)`; `Env.RunGit func(ctx context.Context, dir string, args ...string) ([]byte, error)` |
| F `internal/agentskills` (was `agentcommands`) | `Files(userHome, claudeDir string, harnesses []string, executable, dataHome string) []File`; `type File struct { Skill string; Harnesses []string; Path string; Content []byte }`; `var Registry []Skill`; the rest of the shared names are in [agent-skill.md](agent-skill.md#shared-names) |

Each `Env` field gets an unexported method with a default (as
`Env.launchHandoff` does today), and callers take a small
`read_dependencies.go`-style interface of those methods, never `Env`.

Flags live in `handoff_options.go`: A changes the no-selector rule and
drops `--to`'s forced `--source local` and its `--source archive`
rejection, B adds
`--` passthrough, D adds `--here` / `--new-window`, E adds `--worktree` /
`--branch`.

### Launcher script safety

termlaunch never passes the prompt or paths through AppleScript or tmux
string interpolation. It writes a 0700 `/bin/sh` script, with a random
name created `O_EXCL`, into `ScriptDir` (the launch copy's directory,
which is private to the user) that removes itself, `cd`s to `Dir`,
`unset`s `Unset`, and runs `Argv` (`Argv[0]` absolute, since the new
window's `PATH` may differ), every word POSIX single-quoted
(`'` → `'\''`); when the agent exits non-zero it waits for Enter so a
failure stays readable. The new window does not inherit this process's
environment, only the terminal's own. tmux receives only the script
path, single-quoted. AppleScript receives it as an `osascript` argument
(`on run argv` … `quoted form of item 1 of argv`), never spliced into
the script text.
Terminals: tmux `new-window -c DIR`; iTerm2 `create tab with default
profile command`; Terminal.app `do script`; Ghostty 1.3+ AppleScript `new
tab` with a surface configuration, falling back to Terminal.app.

### Packages and order

| PR | Package | Base | Parallel with |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | this section; option parsing moved to `handoff_options.go` | main | — |
| A | selection | 0 | B, C, F |
| B | launch mechanics, config | 0 | A, C, F |
| C | `internal/termlaunch` | 0 | A, B, F |
| F | `/handoff` commands via setup | 0 | A, B, C |
| D | destination prompt, wiring, no-TTY new window | A + B + C | E |
| E | `--worktree`, active-source prompt | B | D |
| G | docs lead with the one-command flow; live check | all | — |

F merges after D, so `/handoff` never lands before it can open a window.

CI's `deadcode` step fails on any function `main` cannot reach, tests
aside. Every PR wires what it adds into the command, except C, whose
package has no caller until D: C adds `^internal/termlaunch/` to the
exception pattern in `.github/workflows/test.yml`, and D removes it.

### Deviations

Recorded when the packages merged; the code is the reference.

- **`agentskills.Files`** (`agentcommands.Files` until the agent skills plan renamed the package) takes `claudeDir` (Claude Code's configuration
  directory, `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` when set) and `dataHome` (the
  installation's `AGENT_ARCHIVE_HOME`, empty for the default):
  `Files(userHome, claudeDir string, harnesses []string, executable,
  dataHome string) []File`. Claude Code's skill lists `allowed-tools` only
  when the command is the bare executable path; a quoted path or an
  `AGENT_ARCHIVE_HOME=` prefix would not read back as a permission rule, so
  the command is then asked about.
- **Ownership** of a skill file is decided by the marker line plus the data
  directory its command names (item 6), not by a record of what setup
  wrote: the setup journal is deleted once setup commits. Setup also
  removes its file from Claude Code's previous configuration directory
  when `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` changed.
- **`launchSpec.HandoffFile`** was added (the launch copy's path) so D can
  pass its directory as termlaunch's `ScriptDir` and name it when no
  terminal opens.
- **`prepareLaunchDir`** takes an `answers io.Reader` beside `stdin`:
  `stdin` is only checked for a terminal, and every prompt of one command
  (picker, destination, active source) reads through one shared
  `bufio.Reader`, so answers typed ahead are not lost. The worktree is made
  after the launch command is built, so a missing agent or bad arguments
  fail before any worktree exists; a failed launch removes its launch-copy
  directory.
- **`--worktree` without `--to`** is accepted on a terminal where the
  destination prompt is offered; the worktree is made only if an agent is
  chosen (print, copy, and write say none was created). `--here` and
  `--new-window` are accepted the same way. Elsewhere all three still need
  `--to`.
- **`--no-preamble`** also suppresses the destination prompt (item 4):
  `--to` refuses it, so printing is its only use.
- **Choosing an agent at the prompt** runs it in this terminal unless
  `--new-window` is given; only without a terminal does a launch open a new
  window by default.
- **Terminal.app** gets a new window, not a tab (`do script` with no target
  window), and so does the fallback from a Ghostty older than 1.3. iTerm2
  and Ghostty 1.3+ get tabs. The launcher script also waits for Enter when
  it cannot `cd` to the directory.
