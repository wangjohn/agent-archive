# Downloads the binary for this machine's operating system and architecture
# from GitHub Releases, checks it against the release's SHA256SUMS (which
# catches a damaged download, not a tampered release, since both come from
# the same place), and installs it as `agent-archive`. On macOS the binary is
# signed and notarized, and the script also checks that it is signed with
# this project's Developer ID (which does catch a binary someone else built).
# It never runs setup and never needs sudo. On a machine that is already set
# up (a config.json in the data directory) it then runs
# `agent-archive setup --refresh`, which asks nothing and changes only the
# hooks, the background job's definition (the LaunchAgent's plist, or the
# systemd unit files), and the skill files, so they name the new binary; if
# that fails, or this runs as root, the install still succeeds.
#
# Linux release assets (linux-amd64, linux-arm64) are static and not signed,
# so the Developer ID check does not apply to them; the script prints the
# `gh attestation verify` command that confirms where one came from. On every
# OS the SHA256SUMS check is mandatory: the install stops before anything is
# installed if there is no SHA-256 tool, no single well-formed entry, or a
# mismatch. Releases up to v0.1.1 have no Linux asset.
